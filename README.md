# NBA Visualizations

## Summary

#### This project is a full data gathering to visual creation project focused around the NBA.  Data is gathered in from the nba APIs and stored in a Postgres database.  This database is then fed into a PowerBI report where some basic visuals have been created.  This database is currently hosted on a local machine, but the process can be optionally scheduled to run on a service so that data and visuals are updated automatically.
